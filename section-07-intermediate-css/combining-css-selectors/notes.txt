Difference to combine

- Group: separate with coma(,), can add many selectors and apply the same style to them
selector, selector {
    color: value;
}

- Child: select a level down child. Apply to direct child of left side
selector > selector {
    color: firebrick;
}

- Descendant: apply the style to a descendant of left side, separate with space ( ). Could be a grandson, or further.
selector(ancestor) selector(descendant) {
    color: blue;
}

- Chaining: apply where all are true, super specific selector> Ex: h1#title.big.heading. Always starts with element, if want to specify with a element
selectorselector {
    color: seagreen;
}

- Combining Combiners: 
selector selectorselector {
    font-size: 2rem;
}
