# 🇱🇦 Flag of Laos - CSS Only Project

This project was created as part of the **Intermediate CSS module** of the [App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.com/) course. The challenge was to recreate the **flag of Laos** using only **HTML and CSS**, without adding any extra classes, IDs, or HTML elements.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this exercise was to put into practice the concepts learned throughout the intermediate CSS module. It served as a practical assessment to test the ability to use **CSS selectors**, **positioning**, and **layout techniques** in a real-world inspired task.

By building the Laos flag entirely with CSS, we reinforced how to:

- Combine selectors effectively
- Use positioning (`relative` and `absolute`) to control layout
- Apply `border-radius` to create geometric shapes (like the white circle)
- Layer elements using HTML structure and CSS specificity
- Understand how to style deeply nested elements without modifying the HTML

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** 

All CSS code is written inside the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of the HTML file.

---

## 📐 Concepts Applied

- **Combinator Selectors**: e.g., `div > div p` and `.flag > p`  
- **Box Model**: Custom widths and heights for divs  
- **Absolute vs. Relative Positioning**: To align the blue band and the white circle within the flag  
- **Shape Creation**: Using `border-radius: 50%` to create a perfect circle  
- **Color Styling**: Matching flag colors using hex and keyword values  
- **Text Styling and Alignment**: Using `text-align`, `font-size`, and color
