# 🧩 Challenge: CSS `float` Property

## 📄 Description

This is a practical exercise focused on using the CSS `float` and `clear` properties. The goal is to manipulate the layout of elements using only `float` and `clear` to achieve the desired visual structure.

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

1. **Make both paragraph elements wrap around their respective images** using float.
2. **Use float to move the `cat` section to the left and the `dog` section to the right**.
3. **Ensure the footer appears below both the `cat` and `dog` sections** using `clear`.

## 🧪 Instructions

1. Open the HTML file in a browser.
2. Edit the CSS to meet each of the three layout goals.
3. **Do not change the HTML structure**—you should only modify or add CSS rules.
4. Test your layout after each change to understand the impact of `float` and `clear`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (`float`, `clear`, and layout basics)

## 📝 Notes

- This challenge helps reinforce how floating elements affect surrounding content.
- `float` is an older layout method, but still useful and appears in legacy projects.
- Consider using `margin` to improve readability and spacing around floated elements.
